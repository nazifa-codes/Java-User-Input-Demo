# Java-User-Input-Demo

##🎬 "Your story starts with a number, a name, and an age. This project turns that into code."
### 🚀 What It Does
This Java program lets users input their number, name, and age, then displays the info using object-oriented principles. It’s a clean demo of:
• 	🔢 User input via (Scanner)
• 	🧠 Object instantiation with constructors
• 	🎭 Encapsulation of data in a custom class
Perfect for beginners learning Java or creators building interactive CLI tools.

##🧩 How It Works
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int num = sc.nextInt();
String name = sc.nextLine();
int age = sc.nextInt();

name2 n = new name2(num, name, age);
n.myInfo();

### The  class stores the data and prints it in a formatted string. Simple, modular, and ready to scale.
## 📁 File Structure
JavaUserInputDemo/
├── Name1.java       // Main class with user input logic
├── name2.java       // Data class with constructor + display method
└── README.md        // You’re reading it!

## 💡 Why It Matters
Whether you're teaching Java, building a portfolio, or just flexing your coding muscles—this project shows how storytelling and structure come together in code.

## 🎥 Bonus Ideas
Want to turn this into a cinematic coding short?
• 	Add dramatic console effects (like loading dots or ASCII art)
• 	Use voiceover: "Enter your name... and step into the code."
• 	Show side-by-side split screen of code vs. output
